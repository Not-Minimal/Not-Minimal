<h2 align="center">
I'm a Computer Engineering Student and Manager!
</h2> 

Passionate self-taught, admirer and apprentice of technology and investments. In my short life I have had the opportunity to help small/medium-sized companies to improve and automate their logistics and human resources processes. Thanks to this I have been able to help companies in their day to day to improve workflows in the logistics area.
In my free time I dedicate myself to learning programming and investments to continue improving day after day. Programming has allowed me to be creative and bold in solving problems.
Learning about economics has allowed me to consistently support myself.
